A few seconds later, the gunfire suddenly stopped.<new_line><new_line>I raised my head and saw our pursuers through the broken windows. There were three of them, all with AKs.

In the corner, I saw a bucket of dirty water and a mop.<new_line><new_line>In another corner, the coat from Boris's dress uniform was hanging up. It was in perfect condition, which suggested that Boris had only worn it once or twice. Opportunities to do so probably dried up pretty soon after.<new_line><new_line>There was a small dark stain on the stool. It looked like blood.]],

And some gangs, the bigger ones or the desperate ones, used to come at us right here. And they never left. They're here in the ground.' He smirked. 'Now we just get small fry. And only once a month or so.']],

The jailer and two soldiers are standing between the warehouse and the newly built canteen. They're smoking and arguing about something in hushed voices.<new_line><new_line>Behind me is the canal, and on the other bank is the parking lot and the gate that leads out of Stepnoy.

My frayed nerves had finally snapped. My laughter was bitter and frightening, so frightening that Boris flinched.<new_line><new_line>'You're not excusing it, is that it? But you can understand, right?!' I hissed finally. 'You can understand?! Like hell you can! By your standards, I should have just stood by and calmly watched you kill my daughter?!'<new_line><new_line>I pulled out the rifle and pointed it at Boris.]],

I struggled to my feet and, swaying, leaned against the wall. I'd come away from the fight with more than just a few bruises.]],

I felt for the light switch and flicked it, but the lights didn't come on. Either the power was off, there were no bulbs, or they had blown. Somebody had kindly left a hefty flashlight underneath the light switch. It worked, but the battery was running low and the light it emitted was very weak.]],

It contained firewood, broken fencing and chairs with no seats in them.<new_line><new_line>Beside the bucket of wood shavings, there was an old Mosin-Nagant rifle with the stock broken in half. I picked it up. Sure, firing it would be extremely awkward, but it would do in a pinch.<new_line><new_line>I found a few cartridges in the drawer in the table.]],

Initially, I considered doing it myself, but I soon abandoned the idea: going around yelling about fire would be too suspicious.<new_line><new_line>The fire will distract the people of Stepnoy, but my task will still be extremely difficult. Either way, it's done. There's no going back now.]],

The bullet ripped through my shoulder.<new_line><new_line>With inhuman speed, Sasha lunged forward and shoved the lieutenant. He lost his balance and grabbed onto the door frame. Then he swung and punched Sasha. She was thrown sideways.<new_line><new_line>Swiftly assessing the situation, the lieutenant raised his weapon again.]],

Even officers aren't allowed in there. Weapons are issued by the weapons officer, only with the major's permission and only under signature. Every piece of equipment is accounted for. Forget about it.']],

'We're smoking the last ones, see?'<new_line><new_line>'You're lying, you had loads more!' one of the soldiers said angrily.<new_line><new_line>'I had more. The officers bought them all. Cleaned me out,' the jailer said, opening his arms.]],

I ran around the corner to observe.<new_line><new_line>One of the soldiers approached the building. He slowed down when he saw the open door, and then he entered the guard post and shut the door behind him.]],

The canal is fed by the Tom River and it provides Stepnoy with its fresh water.<new_line><new_line>The sides of the canal are almost a sheer drop. If I jump in, I won't be able to get up the other side without special equipment. And no vehicle could make it across either.<new_line><new_line>The only bridge across the canal is a footbridge that goes from the parade ground to the forecourt next to the garages and the parking lot.]],
				['104'] = [[Sasha and I ran to the bridge as fast as we could. Since the fire was already under control, the parade ground was poorly lit, and it would be difficult to pick me and Sasha out from the crowd of soot-covered people running around. We bumped into soldiers a few times, but they just released a colorful stream of curse words at us and ran on to pour water on the flames.<new_line><new_line>Then some soldiers turned around and watched us go with narrowed eyes...<new_line><new_line>There's the bridge to the parking lot!]],

Even worse if it's over something stupid.' The bald man scratched his beard. 'Are we under attack? Has the canal burst its banks? No. Then it can wait till morning. You can find Boris in the command unit first thing.']],
				['61'] = [[There wasn't anything valuable in the coat pockets. In one pocket, I found a gray and crumpled rag that Boris was probably using as a handkerchief. In the other pocket, I found a couple of one ruble coins. Rubles had been worthless for many years.]],

Apart from the rough-hewn stools and the rickety table, there's nothing else in the room. Only one of the four light bulbs works.<new_line><new_line>In the far corner, I can see the door to the closet where I found the rifle.]],

I noticed the major's coat hanging up as I came in.<new_line><new_line>There's a portrait of Brezhnev on the wall, and next to it is a huge map of the Soviet Union.

My first strike found his jaw, but he didn't stagger, he just swung and drove his knee into my stomach. I doubled over and he hit me twice with the butt of his rifle.<new_line><new_line>I fell, and the jailer threw himself on top of me. I suppose I was lucky he didn't just shoot me.

Not weapons, don't worry.'<new_line><new_line>'Using it in any way is prohibited.'<new_line><new_line>I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Where did this prohibition come from? And why tonight?

It's four meters deep and the walls are too steep to climb. Are we going to build a bridge? Or maybe you have some rock climbing gear up your sleeve?']],

Cigarettes are in short supply, and that means that any cigarettes get swiped before anybody knows they're here,' the red-haired soldier said.<new_line><new_line>'Go over the jail,' a bald guy suggested.

He looked terrible: his clothes must have caught fire and he'd rolled around on the ground to put it out. His face and arms were horribly burned. The lieutenant was clearly heading to the attendants' room where the medical supplies were kept.]],
				['31'] = [[I'm in the parking lot. There aren't many vehicles, maybe three or four army UAZs and around eight motorcycles. A KamAZ is in the center, and to the south, right by the town's perimeter fence, is my car.<new_line><new_line>Guards are patrolling in front of Stepnoy's locked gate. This gate is much flimsier than the one at the Abakan base â I think I'd be able to bust through it in a car.<new_line><new_line>The west and north sides of the parking lot are cut off by the canal.

That it wasn't justice?! Your son was a traitor and I got my revenge! You said it yourself: you would have had your own son killed! You would have killed him yourself! So why are you looking at me with hatred? You should want to kiss me!!!']],
				['51'] = [[The shower block was a timber frame construction, darkened from bad weather and fungus. The right side of the building was sagging, and the left had collapsed. The problem likely stemmed from when the foundation was laid.<new_line><new_line>The scarred and split door was locked.]],

They didn't need to be on the alert: no incidents were expected tonight.]],

Until now, I hadn't let myself even consider that none of the keys I'd got from the HQ wouldn't work. I was about to find out. The first key didn't work... The second key didn't work... The third key... got stuck. I strained to turn the key, and it finally did with a screech. The lock fell open.<new_line><new_line>'Who's there?' I heard Sasha say, her voice tense.]],

The officers were running around, giving orders for fighting the fire. There weren't enough buckets, and getting water directly from the canal would be very difficult. Someone was smart enough to start filling buckets from the tap in the infirmary washroom.<new_line><new_line>Hiding here was a good idea.

You've given me the chance to say goodbye to him. Give him a decent burial. It was so important for me.']],

				['111'] = [[The investigator's surname? No, I'm sorry, I don't remember.'<new_line><new_line>'Then maybe you know something about your husband's colleagues?'<new_line><new_line>'Well... I know Georgy Nesterov, he was basically the head of their lab. A good man. He invited us to his house for tea when I went to Moscow to visit Andrey. I saw Shashkov a couple of times too.']],
				['118'] = [[Vanya lay on his stomach in the grass a few meters away from me. A red stain was spreading across his shirt. I ran over to him and turned him over. He was dead. Vanya's face was twisted in an expression of unbearable pain.<new_line><new_line>'God damn it!' was all I could mutter. Then I turned to face Gena.]],
				['26'] = [[Gena sulked the rest of the way to the camp and cast glowering looks my way every so often. Clearly, I was now on his list of mortal enemies, along with Vanya.<new_line><new_line>Seeing Gena, the guards raised the barrier. Soon, word of his safe return had spread around the town and Gena was quickly surrounded by friends and acquaintances rushing forward to embrace him en masse. Gena returned the hugs, but his eyes were grim.]],
				['36'] = [[I asked you here for a reason,' Vanya smirked. 'I knew you'd change your mind. It's hard to get good booze these days.'<new_line><new_line>He retrieved a dusty glass from the nightstand, blew on it, and poured a generous splash of liquor into it. He placed a piece of dried perch on a napkin next to the glass.]],
				['102'] = [[I'll tell you when we get there. Come on, you don't mind, do you?'<new_line><new_line>Intrigued, I didn't argue. Five minutes later, we emerged in a small meadow covered with fine dry grass. There was a pile of embers at the edge of the meadow, next to a fallen pine.]],
				['16'] = [[Gena grabbed my arm.<new_line><new_line>'Fine, fine, I'll tell you. The thing is... There's somebody I want to talk to. Right here, without any witnesses.']],
				['66'] = [[The shot likely echoed through the whole forest.<new_line><new_line>Gena fell from the log and lay motionless on the ground. I rushed over to him, but he was already gone. Even tipsy, Vanya had made sure not to miss: the bullet probably hit Gena right in the heart. He died instantly.<new_line><new_line>'You killed him...' were the only words I could force out.<new_line><new_line>Vanya's face was chalk-white and he was trembling.]],
				['107'] = [[Digging up the soil, I kept thinking about what had happened. Could the murder have been prevented? Probably. I was sure of one thing: I shouldn't have given Gena a gun.<new_line><new_line>The hole was ready. I laid Vanya's body in along with his shotgun, and I tossed the bloodstained grass on top. Then I filled in the grave with soil and concealed it with rotting leaves, just to be sure.<new_line><new_line>For this entire time, Gena just sat on his log in some kind of stupor.]],
				['46'] = [[Vanya stood and coldly sized me up:<new_line><new_line>'To the camp? Fine, whatever you say.'<new_line><new_line>His sudden compliance seemed suspicious, but I didn't think much about why. My mistake. I turned in the direction of the camp, and that's when Vanya hit me in the back of the head with the butt of his shotgun. I fell, Vanya pulled the trigger and... the old gun misfired.]],
				['56'] = [[Gena was about to snap back at me, but he changed his mind at the last second. He was probably afraid that he would finally succeed in pissing me off and that I would leave him here.<new_line><new_line>'Think what you want, I don't care.'<new_line><new_line>'The feeling's mutual,' I replied coolly. At the end of the day, Gena wasn't my son, I wasn't responsible for him.<new_line><new_line>'What are we going to do with the body?' he asked, changing the subject, which I welcomed.]],
				['32'] = [[I tried not to meet anyone's eyes as I made my way to Vanya's house â I didn't want to answer any more questions.<new_line><new_line>Vanya wasn't alone: a half-naked girl was brushing her hair, sitting on the corner of his bed. Vanya was lying under the blanket on his side, sipping liquor from a crystal glass. The girl blushed when I appeared, and she hastily put on a long sweater and left. Vanya didn't even seem to notice that she had left.]],
				['42'] = [[Gena didn't respond, he just looked at me with round eyes. Then I went up to him, raised the gun and held it right under his nose.<new_line><new_line>'He's dead. Do you understand that? You killed someone!'<new_line><new_line>'I...' Gena couldn't find the words, but his face was covered with sweat, 'I didn't mean... It just happened... He... He had a shotgun, he threatened me!'<new_line><new_line>I really wanted to hit him in that moment.]],
				['12'] = [[What?! What the hell are you saying?' Gena clenched his fists. 'You're defending him? You don't get it: this bastard left me to die! He didn't even check on me. And it was his idea in the first place to break through the wall, I told him it would end badly.'<new_line><new_line>Finding no endorsement from me, Gena turned away and was silent.<new_line><new_line>We had entered a patch of fog. It became harder to make our way across the rough terrain, so the conversation was dropped.]],
				['22'] = [[My words enraged him.<new_line><new_line>'Stop treating me like a kid! You're just like them, a boneheaded babysitter! The only thing you can think of is to tell me to play nicely. But I understand things just fine, I wasn't born yesterday. Do you think it's funny that this bastard left me there to die? Is that what you would have done?'<new_line><new_line>'Don't worry,' he didn't even let me respond, 'I'm not gonna kill him. He'll see me with a gun and he'll piss his pants. That will be enough for me.']],
				['103'] = [[Did you talk?' I asked Gena quietly.<new_line><new_line>'We talked,' he replied coolly.<new_line><new_line>'And?'<new_line><new_line>'It's none of your business.' He turned away and closed his eyes.]],
				['65'] = [[They were standing three meters apart, both red-faced, agitated, looking like they were about to lunge at one another. Finally, Vanya yelled:<new_line><new_line>'Why don't you just go to hell, huh?! That's it, I'm done. Innocent victim, my ass! If I'd been trapped in that building, you would run away! What? You don't think so?']],
				['64'] = [[And what will happen when people realize that Vanya's missing?' Gena asked me on the way.<new_line><new_line>'You don't know anything. I don't know anything. Nobody saw us leave together. They'll guess that Vanya went hunting and that the wolves got him. And even if somebody did see us together â I won't be in the camp by then.'<new_line><new_line>Seeing Gena, the guards raised the barrier. The news that the guy returned alive quickly spread throughout the camp. And within a few minutes he was surrounded by acquaintances and friends.]],
				['63'] = [[He'll be back,' Gena said doubtfully, 'sooner or later.'<new_line><new_line>'Then I'll come back too and finish things. But he won't last long in the wasteland. Without gear, provisions, with virtually no ammunition... He'll be got by predators before he ever reaches another settlement. Right, enough chatting, your mom's waiting for you â let's not drag it out for her.'<new_line><new_line>I not only saved the kid, I stopped him from becoming a murderer. I think I've done everything right.]],
				['7'] = [[The lynx jumped and sank its teeth into Gena's throat. I reacted after a second, shooting it in the head, but it was already too late: a fountain of blood was gushing from Gena's ripped neck. I tried to cover the awful wound with my hand, even though I knew that Gena was already done for.<new_line><new_line>He was dead within seconds.<new_line><new_line>Now I just have to get his body out and take it to Nadezhda. If only I could have got her son back alive...]],
				['6'] = [[The lynx looked at me appraisingly, then turned towards Gena and dropped closer to the ground.<new_line><new_line>I'm holding a gun and the lynx doesn't even see me as a threat! This isn't the first time I've seen this: predators exposed to radiation seem to have lost all fear. They're like rabid dogs, their instinct for self-preservation has been suppressed<new_line><new_line>Now their primary instinct is hunger.]],
				['9'] = [[Gena perked up a little after drinking some water. He even tried to eat.<new_line><new_line>'Lie down and don't move!' I told him. 'You're awfully energetic for somebody who's been trapped under rubble for a day. Your right leg tells a different story though. And you've probably swallowed some radioactive dust.'<new_line><new_line>'That sucks,' Gena sighed. 'Will I be able to walk?'<new_line><new_line>'Right now? No way.'<new_line><new_line>'And in the future?']],
				['8'] = [[When the lynx was dead, I dragged the heavy carcass into a corner and got back to work. Gena was mumbling something and weakly pushing away at the air with his hand. I shoved the largest piece aside and saw a sledgehammer. Strange...<new_line><new_line>I got Gena out and gently carried him into the room and laid him on a small couch.]],
				['55'] = [[Thanks. I'm glad you see things my way,' Gena said in relief, extending his hand towards me. I couldn't bring myself to shake his hand. Gena noticed, frowning, but said nothing.]],
				['54'] = [[Gena's face twisted in anger. Suddenly he roared:<new_line><new_line>'Do you think I'm just a stupid kid?! I only have one thing to say to you: I'm not sorry for anything! He deserved it. You got that? He left me to die, and I got him back for it!<new_line><new_line>'And what, you feel better now?'<new_line><new_line>'Yeah! I feel great! It was justice!']],

A red stain was spreading swiftly across his shirt.<new_line><new_line>I ran over to him and turned him over. He was dead. Vanya's face was twisted in an expression of unbearable pain.<new_line><new_line>'God damn it!' was all I could mutter. Then I turned to face Gena.]],

You can also get stuff made from rowanberries, but it's not as good without pickles on the side.'<new_line><new_line>Vanya sipped the drink and seemed to be thinking.<new_line><new_line>'What do you think of Lera? The girl who ran away. At first glance, she's nothing special, but she doesn't put on an act like some people. And I've got options â you know what I mean. But I meant to say to you...']],
				['1'] = [[I made my way through the dusty entrance and up the stairs. On the third-floor landing, I encountered a pile of concrete rubble that almost reached the ceiling. A lone piece of steel piping was sticking out of the pile, and the corridor beyond was blocked by a cracked flooring slab from a floor higher up.<new_line><new_line>A large hole gaped in ceiling above me. I shone my flashlight up and could make out the cracked ceiling of what must have been the fifth floor.<new_line><new_line>Similar cracks snaked along the plaster on the third floor.]],

Does your mommy know you've got that? She'll put you in timeout!'<new_line><new_line>'You're a dead man...' Gena murmured. Vanya snorted mockingly and set off back towards camp.]],
				['3'] = [[It took more than three hours before I managed to overcome the barrier.

And that was being optimistic.<new_line><new_line>I surveyed the cracked walls distrustfully. The load-bearing wall behind the rubble was missing. I have to work very carefully if I don't want the building caving in on my head.]],
				['108'] = [[I was digging up the soil in a fury, using every word I could think of to yell at Gena. But maybe part of the blame lay with me: I shouldn't have given Gena a gun and I shouldn't have left him alone with Vanya.<new_line><new_line>The hole was ready. I laid Vanya's body in along with his shotgun, and I tossed the bloodstained grass on top. Then I filled in the grave with soil and concealed it with rotting leaves, just to be sure.<new_line><new_line>For this entire time, Gena just sat on his log in some kind of stupor.]],
				['4'] = [[When I arrived at the camp with Gena's body, light, practically weightless, all the locals gathered around. They watched mournfully as I laid the body on a sheet, and they were silent. Two women whispered placating words to Nadezhda, gently holding her by the hands. Vanya was nowhere to be seen. He had probably drunk all his Bryansk booze and was sleeping it off.<new_line><new_line>Two men with shovels left to dig the grave, then the rest started to disperse. Nadezhda bent towards her son and lovingly stroked his hair. She wasn't crying, she had probably cried all her tears before now.

				['37'] = [[After finishing his sixth sordid story recalling his sexual exploits, Vanya set the glass down and settled back against the cushion.<new_line><new_line>'Well, should we go hunting now?'

The wolf didn't even finish him off, it was going for Gavrilov, but my stepdad grabbed it with his arms and held it back. The wolf tore at him, but he held on... Until fully bled out.
