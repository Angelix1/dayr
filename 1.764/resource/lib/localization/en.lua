He slept with it under his pillow, he even kept it when he went for a swim. It always made me laugh. One time, I hid the knife as a joke, and my stepdad beat me bloody.

And they're afraid, of course. Although,' he added, 'you shouldn't underestimate the sleeping wolves.']],

It dropped dead, but its victim was beyond saving.

The bullet ripped through my shoulder.<new_line><new_line>With inhuman speed, Sasha lunged forward and shoved the lieutenant. He lost his balance and grabbed onto the door frame. Then he swung and punched Sasha. She was thrown sideways.<new_line><new_line>Swiftly assessing the situation, the lieutenant raised his weapon again.]],

Life has already taught me all I need to know!'<new_line><new_line>'He wouldn't have done anything to us!'<new_line><new_line>'Oh really?!' Sasha lifted the hem of dead man's shirt and I saw the handle of the gun. 'You're saying that snake wouldn't have hit you from behind if he'd had the chance?!']],
				['78'] = [[Without thinking twice, I took the rifle stolen from the guard post and fired at the jailer. The bullet must have hit his heart, because he died almost instantly. The expression captured forever on his face wasn't one of fear, but one of genuine confusion.<new_line><new_line>I could only hope that nobody had heard the gunshot.]],
				['155'] = [[Hold tight!' I shouted at Sasha. The vehicle smashed into the gate at full tilt. The collision shook us, but as I suspected, the hinges didn't hold.<new_line><new_line>We broke through.<new_line><new_line>The military town was behind us.]],
				['18'] = [[I want a lot of things too,' the bald man said, narrowing his eyes. 'Where is it you need to go?']],

'And we were so close!'<new_line><new_line>She got out of the car, walked a few meters towards the gate and immediately came back.<new_line><new_line>'We've got a minute to come up with something. There's a squad on the bridge. Ten or twelve guys, all armed. And Boris is with them.']],
				['143'] = [[Nobody came in, and after a few minutes, the soldiers left. We went out into the kitchen. What were they doing in here? A barrel of water had gone.<new_line><new_line>I hadn't realized that Stepnoy's water supply was so bad. I hoped the fire wouldn't reach the diesel tanks after all...<new_line><new_line>Sasha distracted me from these thoughts, demanding that we keep moving.]],
				['126'] = [[I can,' Boris replied with more certainty. 'I'm not excusing it, but I can understand.'<new_line><new_line>And then I started laughing right in his face. My frayed nerves had finally snapped. My laughter was bitter and frightening, so frightening that Boris flinched.<new_line><new_line>'You're not excusing it, is that it? But you can understand, right?!' I hissed finally. 'You can understand?! Like hell you can! By your standards, I should have just stood by and calmly watched you kill my daughter?!'<new_line><new_line>I pulled out the rifle and pointed it at Boris.]],

Sasha asked with a sad, wry smile.<new_line><new_line>The soldiers weren't visible from the car: the KamAZ and the UAZs lay between us and them. I adjusted my grip on the rifle and opened the door.<new_line><new_line>'Where the hell are you going? They'll destroy you!']],
				['134'] = [[Yeah,' another soldier replied. 'His son, Vasily, was killed only a couple years back. By the Abakans. They delivered his decapitated head to us. Boris almost died from grief. We thought he'd just crawl into the bottle, but he didn't, he held it together. He's a tough comrade. It's a pity we never found out which one of those bastards killed Vasily. I'd gut the guy personally.'<new_line><new_line>The others nodded in agreement.]],
				['147'] = [[Carefully opening the outer door, I saw people swarming around the burning building, mostly half-dressed soldiers. The officers were running around, giving orders for fighting the fire. There weren't enough buckets, and getting water directly from the canal would be very difficult. Someone was smart enough to start filling buckets from the tap in the infirmary washroom.<new_line><new_line>Hiding here was a good idea. As soon as the area was clear, I'm going to sprint towards the jail. I hope I don't have to wait long: the nauseating smell was killing me.]],
				['57'] = [[There's another large window at the back of the command unit. I could climb through there. I'll need a crowbar or something similar to break the glass.<new_line><new_line>The generator is noisy, so it's unlikely anybody will hear the glass smashing.]],

All three of them tensed as they waited to hear what I would say.<new_line><new_line>I had probably interrupted an important conversation.]],
				['97'] = [[The speed with which Sasha grabbed the rifle and shot the lieutenant in the stomach was inhuman. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't have believed it. The lieutenant dropped his rifle, moved back and slowly sank to the floor.<new_line><new_line>Sasha turned to me and made a gesture of invitation. I didn't know what she meant.

When she saw the fire in the distance, Sasha gave a crooked smile. I couldn't work out the meaning of those smiles.<new_line><new_line>'Hang on,' she said suddenly. She went back and returned a few seconds later, clasping the jailer's rifle. 'This will give us a boost.']],
				['77'] = [[It was a perfect hit. The guy went down like a ton of bricks.<new_line><new_line>I hope he was just knocked out. I could have easily fractured his skull.]],

You did a good job getting the missile systems and all, but we were the first ones to go in under the grenades and the mines. But the major's drinking wine with you like you took down the Abakans single-handedly. He didn't even bump up our rations!'<new_line><new_line>'Yeah, and how come the girl almost got you?' another soldier piped up, 'Were you afraid of offending the lady or something?']],

I whispered back.<new_line><new_line>Sasha looked around at the truck behind us and licked her parched lips:<new_line><new_line>'Yeah, good idea!'<new_line><new_line>We crept over to the KamAZ's cab. Firing from here would be much safer than from our previous position.]],

The soldier dropped like a ton of bricks.<new_line><new_line>Grunting in pain, I dragged myself to my feet. I hope nothing is broken. I wonder if the jailer is just out for the count or if I fractured his skull...]],

'They'll mow us down while we're running over there!'<new_line><new_line>'You run from the left, I'll run from the right! Three... two... one... go!'<new_line><new_line>My plan worked! Our opponents only fired off a couple of shots and none of them hit their target. We made it to the garages unscathed.]],

'We're smoking the last ones, see?'<new_line><new_line>'You're lying, you had loads more!' one of the soldiers said angrily.<new_line><new_line>'I had more. The officers bought them all. Cleaned me out,' the jailer said, opening his arms.]],

I have only one thing to say to that – hogwash!'<new_line><new_line>Boris didn't respond right away.<new_line><new_line>'You're wrong. I think I would have killed him. But I... I couldn't have lived with myself afterwards. You made a different choice. And I... I can understand why you did it.'<new_line><new_line>I spat contemptuously.]],

The canal is fed by the Tom River and it provides Stepnoy with its fresh water.<new_line><new_line>The sides of the canal are almost a sheer drop. If I jump in, I won't be able to get up the other side without special equipment. And no vehicle could make it across either.<new_line><new_line>The only bridge across the canal is a footbridge that goes from the parade ground to the forecourt next to the garages and the parking lot.]],

In the corner, I saw a bucket of dirty water and a mop.<new_line><new_line>In another corner, the coat from Boris's dress uniform was hanging up. It was in perfect condition, which suggested that Boris had only worn it once or twice. Opportunities to do so probably dried up pretty soon after.<new_line><new_line>There was a small dark stain on the stool. It looked like blood.]],
				['72'] = [[I ran to the shower block and went into the changing room to wait.<new_line><new_line>The fire got going much faster than I expected. In less than ten minutes, the silence was broken by wailing sirens. Somebody had seen the fire.]],
				['82'] = [[It was pitch black in the dank jail. I couldn't make out the bars or the cells beyond them.<new_line><new_line>I felt for the lock and started trying the keys. Until now, I hadn't let myself even consider that none of the keys I'd got from the HQ wouldn't work. I was about to find out. The first key didn't work... The second key didn't work... The third key... got stuck. I strained to turn the key, and it finally did with a screech. The lock fell open.<new_line><new_line>'Who's there?' I heard Sasha say, her voice tense.]],

Then Sasha waved her hand, coolly stepped over to the injured soldier and slit his throat with his own knife.]],

As I had hoped all along, the Stepnoy soldiers had reacted so swiftly to the emergency that the tanks of diesel hadn't had time to heat enough to combust.
